# Successor Operation Examples
The examples here are meant to cover general use and edge cases of the successor operation. 

The examples have a tape vocabulary in the set {0, 1}. The default tape character is 0. 

Valid input strings have the following format: 1^(n) for the operation (n + 1). 

## Example 001
(5 + 1): Covers a simple successor case with a small number.

## Example 002
(1 + 1): Covers a simple successor edge case with the only operand equal to 1.

## Example 003
(0 + 1): Covers a simple successor edge case with the only operand equal to 0.

## Example 004
(64 + 1): Covers a simple successor case with a large number.
