# Multiplication Operation Examples
The examples here are meant to cover general use and edge cases of multiplication. 

The examples have a tape vocabulary in the set {0, 1}. The default tape character is 0. 

Valid input strings have the following format: 1^(m+1) 0^(1) 1^(n+1) for the operation (m * n).

## Example 001
(3 * 5): Covers a simple multiplication case with small numbers.

## Example 002
(1 * 4): Covers a simple multiplication case with small numbers and the edge case of 1 as the first operand.

## Example 003
(7 * 1): Covers a simple multiplication case with small numbers and the edge case of 1 as the second operand.

## Example 004
(0 * 2): Covers a simple multiplication case with small numbers and the edge case of 0 as the first operand.

## Example 005
(3 * 0): Covers a simple multiplication case with small numbers and the edge case of 0 as the second operand.

## Example 006
(1 * 1): Covers a simple multiplication case with 1 as the first and second operands.

## Example 007
(0 * 0): Covers a simple multiplication case with 0 as the first and second operands.

## Example 008
(3 * 103): Covers a simple multiplication case with a large second operand.
