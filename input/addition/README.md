# Addition Operation Examples
The examples here are meant to cover general use and edge cases of addition. 

The examples have a tape vocabulary in the set {0, 1}. The default tape character is 0. 

Valid input strings have the following format: 1^(m+1) 0^(1) 1^(n+1) for the operation (m + n).

## Example 001
(2 + 3): Covers a simple addition case with small numbers. 

## Example 002
(1 + 6): Covers a simple addition case with small numbers and the edge case of 1 as the first operand.
